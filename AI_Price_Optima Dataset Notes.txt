AI_Price_Optima Dataset Notes

This dataset is mainly used for Dynamic Pricing Optimization using AI/ML.

It contains information about product prices, sales, inventory, and time.

Dataset Overview

The dataset has 3,00,000 rows and 5 columns:

Column Name	     Meaning
product_id	  Unique ID for each product
price	Current   selling price of the product
sales_quantity	  Number of units sold
inventory	  Available stock in warehouse
date	          Date and time of transaction

Predict demand
Adjust product price automatically
Improve business profit
Avoid overstock and stock shortage

KEY FEATURES
1. Price Impacts Sales
Higher price may reduce sales quantity

Lower price may increase sales

2. Inventory Affects Pricing

If inventory is high → price can be reduced to increase sales
If inventory is low → price can be increased to maximize profit

3. Demand Changes Over Time
Sales depend on:

->Season
->Festivals
->Customer demand
->Time of purchase
The date column helps capture these trends.

4. Dynamic Pricing Concept
Dynamic pricing means:
->Prices change automatically based on market conditions.

Example:
Uber surge pricing
Amazon product price changes

5. AI Helps Optimize Revenue
Using ML algorithms, we can predict:
Expected sales quantity
Best price for maximum profit
