Simple Case Study (AI Price Optimization)
Case Study: Smart Pricing in an Online Store
Problem

An e-commerce company sells thousands of products daily.
They face issues like:
Wrong pricing decisions
Overstock of unsold products
Low profit during high demand Dataset Used

The company uses the AI_Price_Optima dataset, which includes:

Product price
Units sold
Inventory stock
Transaction date
AI Solution

The company builds a Dynamic Pricing Model that:

Increases price when demand is high
Decreases price when inventory is too much
Predicts future sales trends

Example Scenario

Situation	                         AI Pricing Action
Inventory is high and sales are low	Reduce price to boost demand
Inventory is low but sales are high	Increase price to maximize profit                        
Seasonal demand increases	        Adjust price based on trend

code

->This code is basically used to convert your raw dataset into the final AI_Price_Optima CSV format.

# Generate sales quantity
df["sales_quantity"] = (
    ((df["price"].max() - df["price"]) / df["price"].max()) * 50
    + (df["inventory"] / df["inventory"].max()) * 30
    + np.random.randint(1, 10, len(df))
).astype(int)
# Final dataset
final_df = df[["product_id", "price", "sales_quantity", "inventory", "date"]]
# Save CSV in project folder
final_df.to_csv("final_dynamic_pricing_dataset.csv", index=False)

print("✅ Final CSV created successfully!")
